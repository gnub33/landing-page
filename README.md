The Odin Project's CSS Foundation project

My biggest issue is how the site falls apart with a smaller browser size. 
Hope to address this problem after completing media query and responsive web design lessons.
I may go back personalize the site in the future. I'm thinking of a movie production service. The people could be crew members and the quote a testimonial.
